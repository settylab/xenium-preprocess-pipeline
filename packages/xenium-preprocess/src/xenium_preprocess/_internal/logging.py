"""Minimal logging helper for xenium-preprocess.

`log(msg)` prints a timestamped, flushed line to stdout. Use it for
every per-stage progress line so the log file shows where time goes
and (critically) so output never sits in stdio buffers when Slurm
SIGKILLs a job at the time limit.

Belt + braces vs `python -u` / PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1: each `log()` call
also explicitly flushes. If a downstream library reopens stdout, this
still works.
