#!/usr/bin/env bash
# scripts/create-env.sh — create the micromamba env used by this
# pipeline, self-verifying that the package cache stayed isolated.
#
# micromamba's `pkgs_dirs` resolves to `[<root>/pkgs, ~/.mamba/pkgs]`
# even when `MAMBA_ROOT_PREFIX` is overridden to an isolated location
# — an undocumented second entry. Nothing errors when this fires: a
# user who sets MAMBA_ROOT_PREFIX expecting a fully self-contained
# install can still end up with package-cache state silently written
# to `~/.mamba/pkgs`. This wraps `micromamba create` with an explicit
# `CONDA_PKGS_DIRS` override (when MAMBA_ROOT_PREFIX is set) and
# asserts, after the fact, that `~/.mamba/pkgs` was not touched — the
# failure mode is silent, so the invariant has to check itself rather
# than being trusted.
#
# If MAMBA_ROOT_PREFIX is NOT set, this is a thin passthrough to
# `micromamba create` (the default root already IS ~/.mamba, so there
# is nothing to isolate and nothing to assert).
#
# Separately, micromamba ALWAYS registers every env it creates into a
# second, global, `$HOME`-scoped registry — `~/.conda/environments.txt`
# — regardless of `MAMBA_ROOT_PREFIX` and with no flag to opt out
# (verified against `micromamba create --help`: no such flag exists).
# Unlike `~/.mamba/pkgs`, this one cannot be avoided, so this script
# does not assert it's untouched (it always will be) — instead it (a)
# says so out loud below instead of silently omitting it from the
# isolation report, and (b) resolves and records the env's own prefix
# itself (see "env prefix" below), so nothing downstream needs to
# scrape that registry to find it — the registry accumulates one row
# per env ever created on this account, across every root, so grepping
# it for a name match returns every prior install too, not just this
# one.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/create-env.sh -n xenium -f environments/xenium.yml
#   MAMBA_ROOT_PREFIX=/abs/isolated/root scripts/create-env.sh \
#       -n xenium -f environments/xenium.yml
#
# All arguments are passed through to `micromamba create` verbatim.
#
# Side effect: if a `-n`/`--name` env name is present in the arguments,
# writes the resolved absolute env prefix to
# `scripts/.env-prefix-<name>` (gitignored) — `write-env-config.sh
# --env-name <name>` reads this back instead of asking the user to
# find the path by hand.
