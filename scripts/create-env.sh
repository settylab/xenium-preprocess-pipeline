#!/usr/bin/env bash
# scripts/create-env.sh — create the micromamba env used by this
# pipeline, self-verifying that the package cache stayed isolated.
#
# micromamba's `pkgs_dirs` resolves to `[<root>/pkgs, ~/.mamba/pkgs]`
# even when `MAMBA_ROOT_PREFIX` is overridden to an isolated location
# — an undocumented second entry. Nothing errors when this fires: a
# user who sets MAMBA_ROOT_PREFIX expecting a fully self-contained
# install can still end up with package-cache state silently written
# to `~/.mamba/pkgs`. This wraps `micromamba create` with an explicit
# `CONDA_PKGS_DIRS` override (when MAMBA_ROOT_PREFIX is set) and
# asserts, after the fact, that `~/.mamba/pkgs` was not touched — the
# failure mode is silent, so the invariant has to check itself rather
# than being trusted.
#
# If MAMBA_ROOT_PREFIX is NOT set, this is a thin passthrough to
# `micromamba create` (the default root already IS ~/.mamba, so there
# is nothing to isolate and nothing to assert).
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/create-env.sh -n xenium -f environments/xenium.yml
#   MAMBA_ROOT_PREFIX=/abs/isolated/root scripts/create-env.sh \
#       -n xenium -f environments/xenium.yml
#
# All arguments are passed through to `micromamba create` verbatim.
